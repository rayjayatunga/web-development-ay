     <h2>Summary</h2>
     <p>I am a self-taught developer and AI enthusiast with a drive to solve real-world problems by applying creative engineering solutions.  I love exploring the capabilities of new tools and frameworks
        and sharing my learnings with others. Two notable AI projects I worked on include developing a semantic search tool to help Canadian Permanent Resident 
        applicants in Canada find their NOC classification and building an AI-powered Spotify personal DJ assistant. I am currently learning web development with the aim of being able to share the useful apps I build.

     <h2>Experience</h2>
     <h3>Innovation Engineer | Shopify | Aug 2021 - Present</h3>
     <p>
        In my role at Shopify, Iâ€™ve been deeply involved in fostering innovation, particularly in emerging technologies like generative AI, AR/VR, and blockchain. I collaborated
         with R&D engineers across these domains, helping to drive knowledge exchange and push technological boundaries. I built and deployed an internal web app using FAISS to 
         enable semantic searches across our patent assets as well as our internal hackathon projects, which facilitated greater participation and engagement. Additionally, I contributed
          the expansion of our patent portfolio by running ideation sessions and capturing inventive concepts. I also developed an inventor recognition program and streamlined internal processes
        through building numerous workflow automations.

     <p>
        Spurred by my motivation to help my own sister with her PR application, I built and deployed a streamlit web-app to semantically match jobs in the National Occupational Classification (NOC) to a candidate's previous work experience, reducing the friction of searching over 600 potential NOC codes. Tools used:
        <ul>
            <li>Streamlit ( Front-end)</li>
            <li>sentence-transformer library (embedding models)</li>
            <li>FAISS (vector storage and processing)</li>
            <li>OpenAI and Cohere APIs for LLM handling of text</li>
        </ul>
